# hello-world
This is my first git repository, a place to store ideas, resources, or even share and discuss things with others.

I'm taking CS50x, instead of continuing with the USC C++ course, which introduced me to the Oracle
VM, command line programming, and was really interesting. I'm going to complete CS50x, get my cert,
then...I'll look toward the next natural step. Rigor is the only requirement as I take down the
courses for a Logic & Computation major at CMU.
